# Bitcoin and Cryptos interface Profitabily

this is an application developed in 2014 when I was mining cryptocurrency.
I let you judge very particular coding style, but this application has helped me a lot to stay profitable in my mining. 
Initially it was a project-oriented discussion area for mastering work that I had created for my company.
